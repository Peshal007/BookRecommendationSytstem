2.2. Libraries Used:
python-notebook - Python Text Editor

numpy, scipy- number python library
pandas - data handling library
2.3 Frontend

Main Objective:


The objective was to display the top 50 books with the highest average rating but we will display only those books which got a minimum of 250 votes. I kept only those users who have rated at least 200 books as they are knowledgeable reviewers for the selection of top50 books
